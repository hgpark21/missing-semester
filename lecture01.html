<h1> Missing-Semester: Lecture 1. The Shell-Summary </h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Command Shell</li>
  <li>Version Control</li>
  <li>Text Editing</li>
  <li>Remote Machines</li>
  <li>Finding Files</li>
  <li>Data Wrangling</li>
  <li>Virtual Machines</li>
  <li>Security</li>
</ul>

<h2> Exercises </h2>

<ol>

  <li>
    Create a new directory called missing under <tt>/tmp</tt>.
  </li>

  <li>
    Look up the touch program. The man program is your friend.
  </li>

  <li>
    Use touch to create a new file called <tt>semester</tt> in missing.
  </li>

  <li>
    Write the following into that file, one line at a time:
      <pre>
        #!/bin/sh
        curl --head --silent https://missing.csail.mit.edu
      </pre>
    The first line might be tricky to get working. It's helpful to know that <tt>#</tt> starts a comment in <tt>Bash</tt>, and <tt>!</tt> has a special meaning even within double-quoted (") strings. Bash treats single-quoted strings (') differently: they will do the trick in this case. (See the Bash quoting manual page for more information.)
  </li>

  <li>Try to execute the file, i.e. type the path to the script (<tt>./semester</tt>) into your shell and press enter. Understand why it doesn't work by consulting the output of <tt>ls</tt> (hint: look at the <strong>permission bits</strong> of the file).</li>
  <li> Run the command by explicitly starting the <tt>sh</tt> interpreter, and giving it the file semester as the first argument, i.e. <tt>sh semester</tt>. Why does this work, while <tt>./semester</tt> didn't?</li>
  <li> Look up the chmod program (e.g. use <tt>man chmod</tt>). Use <tt>chmod</tt> to make it possible to run the command <tt>./semester</tt> rather than having to type <tt>sh semester</tt>. How does your shell know that the file is supposed to be interpreted using <tt>sh</tt>? See this page on the shebang line for more information. </li>
  <li> Use <tt>|</tt> and <tt>></tt> to write the "last modified" date output by semester into a file called <tt>last-modified.txt</tt> in your home directory. </li>
  <li> Write a command that reads out your laptop batteryâ€™'s power level or your desktop machine's CPU temperature from <tt>/sys</tt>. Note: if you're a macOS user, your OS doesn't have <tt>sysfs</tt>, so you can skip this exercise.</li>
</ol>
